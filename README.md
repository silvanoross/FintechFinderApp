# Installation Guide

Everything to run this code is mainly included with an installation of anaconda excluding 'Streamlit', 'bip44', 'web3' and dotenv. Additionally, you will need a [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) terminal

Go to the [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) website to fully install python and its dependencies. 

A conda enviornment will need to be created. Go to your GitBash terminal and enter to create and activate your environment:
```python
    conda create --name myenv
    
    conda activate myenv
```
Note: 'myenv' can be any name you choose.

Next, you can use conda and pip to install the additional packages. Use the following commands:

```python
    conda install -c conda-forge streamlit
    pip install python-dotenv
    pip install web3==5.17
    pip install bip44

```

These are all the required packages you need to run this application.

<div style="text-align: left"><img src="./images/mnemonic_ganache.png" width="600" /></div> <div style="text-align: left"><img src="./images/env_file.png" width="700" /></div>

### Note: the mnemonic will be different for you and will change every time you launch Ganache.

## Running the Application

### Open 'fintech_finer.py' in your integrated terminal you set up at the beginning of this exercise. 
### Enter the following command to run the web application:

```python
    streamlit run fintech_finer.py
```
### This launches a local server in you default browser

## Overview
* ### Through the Ganache app this local server allows the user to make transactions using blockchain technology
* ### The user will choose the person they want for a potential job based on their hourly rate and picture. 
* ### Next the user can decide how many hours they want to contract this person
* ### Finally the user can send the transaction in a mock Ethereum environment and see the change in their balance on Ganache
